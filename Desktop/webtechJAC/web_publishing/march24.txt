tables

colgroup  => class, id, width
<col width="10%" /> (column 1)
<col width="20%" /> (column 2)
<col /> (column 3)
</colgroup>

attributes for colgroup: align || valign || class || id
     attributes for col: class || id     || width || span

colgroup is useless if not grouping columns together
can just do <col width="10%" span="3" /> in HTML

span for col tag says the actual SPAN of the width property, say 10% and span=3 makes 3 rows on the column with 10% width EACH! (important)


multiple colgroups are useful, and you can apply classes too to do that. Column references sum, even when starting a new colgroup!
