Site Planning

Objective: Make a website for a vintage guitar equipment store. The purpose of
this site is to provide clients with information regarding products and the
local goings-on of the store, such as store events. There will not be the
functionality to purchase online, but some products are available to look at via
images and a short explanation. A contact form provides a useful feature for
filtering out certain questions (for example, the amplifier questions would go
to my amp repairperson), but the server-side scripting is not complete
yet.


Site Map:

      Index.html (landing page)
              |  A
              |  |
              |  |
              V  |
-----> All the others (Others) <-----

Others point both to themselves and to the landing page.


In guitars.html && amplifiers.html, <the request info> link sends users to:

--------> contact.html#info (named anchor)


Screen and Browser Specs Designed For:

Screen: 1024px x 768px (most popular here)

Browser versions: Uses CSS3 properties (that a CSS validator said were wrong,
but they're just new!). Should degrade gracefully for people with browsers < 
IE8. Only difference will be no shadowing, gradients or rounded corners.


Landing-page Mockup
