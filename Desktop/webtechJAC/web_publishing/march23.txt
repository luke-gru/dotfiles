centering: Use a container!
a) text-align center on container
b) give container a width, specify margins { margin: 0 auto; } (0 margin for the x, auto for the y)
c) no width, just give margins on left & right

CSS positioning properties:
position: { 
absolute; (to the parent element) with top, bottom, left, right
fixed; with respect to the window, elements stay where they are!
relative; relative to the element's position without css properties, and takes up the actual space of where it was without the positioning properties


top (more stable axis):
left (more stable axis):
bottom:
right:

z-index: stacking precedence: higher = on top (default is the order of the elements in the HTML code, last = on top)

when positioning: it's positioning the content!

fixed position elements are taken out of the 'static' layer and if nothing goes over it with a higher z-index then it remains on top

vertical align: top; middle; bottom;
display: inline; block; none (noshow)
visibility: hidden; visible (default)
clear: which side of the element should not have content around it
left; right; both;
