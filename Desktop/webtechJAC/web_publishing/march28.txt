Site planning:

-What and who is it for?
-budget (time and $)

Design
Information design (content)
Navigation design (structure) => linear (2 follows 1, 3 follows 2)
            => hierarchical (tree structure for lots of info)
            => metaphorical navigation (images, graphics)
graphic design
spoke-and-hub (central home)
full-web          => sort of mix of all
