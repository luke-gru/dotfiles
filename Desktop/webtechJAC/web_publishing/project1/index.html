      <h3>Only Girls?</h3>
      <p>There aren't enough girls (and women) who like to program.
      But <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> was designed
      so that the programming language itself is similar to a natural language,
      like French or English. This makes it more suitable for quick
      learning, and for non-technical people to grasp the concepts behind
      it.</p>
      <h3>Are you assuming girls are non-technical? How dare you!</h3>
      <p>No! You're twisting my words! All are welcome at the Girls_on_Rails => 'mtl' meetups,
      but you're only allowed to come if you're accompanied by an interested girl/woman. Even
      though women have made huge dents in other traditionally male-dominated fields and 
      activities, it seems that web development and computer programming have been left behind.
      So spread the word, tell all your girl friends and come ride the Rails!</p>
      <h3 class="meetups">Meetups</h3>
      <p class="meetups">The first meetup has not started yet, as people are in the process
      of signing up. You will get an e-mail letting you know when the first meetup
      is taking place. Typically, they should be about every two weeks.</p>
