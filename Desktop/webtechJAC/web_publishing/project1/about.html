      <h3>The Teacher(s)</h3>
      <p>There will hopefully be more than one teacher, but for now there's <a href="http://www.github.com/luke-gru">me</a>. Hopefully, as the
      workshop progresses there will be others as well. The Ruby and Rails communities are great, and the people involved will
      definitely be able to help you out. Since you're probably just getting your feet wet, this Ruby <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/">quickstart</a>
      tutorial is as good a place to start as any.</p>
      <h3>Level</h3>
      <p id="second">Beginners are encouraged to come. In fact, it's <em>for</em> beginners. We won't
      assume any prior knowledge of web development or web design. That doesn't mean that you can't already have, say, some 
      HTML or CSS knowledge. We won't be turning down anyone (unless they're a lone guy). It is, however, recommended to
      have a good grasp of the English language and some strong logical skills. If you're a good debater or good at doing
      Sudokus, you can bet you'll be good at picking up Ruby on Rails.</p>

      <h3 class="meetups">Starting Points</h3>
      <p class="meetups">So you're eager to get started and don't know where to go. These were all helpful sites to me when I got started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">download</a> Ruby first.</li>
        <li>Mr. Neighborly's <a href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/book/html/chapter1.html"><span class="title">Humble Little Ruby Book</span></a></li>
        <li><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=00"><span class="title">Learn to Program</span></a> by Chris Pine</li>
        <li>And finally, the official <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Starting Ruby on Rails</a> guide</li>
      </ul>
