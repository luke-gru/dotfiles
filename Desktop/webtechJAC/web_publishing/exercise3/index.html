    <h2 id="second">What is a Web Browser?</h2>
    <p>A Web browser is a piece of software that allows the user of the browser to view Web pages and all their associated documents and media.
    Using a browser, a user can click on hyperlinks and visit other pages, or browse the content of the current Web page to read text, listen to music,
    play video, draw on 'canvas' (with html5) and basically do all the fun things that the Web has to offer. These days, browsers also have many other features
    that make them less 'dumb' than they used to be (Web browsers have gotten a bad wrap for quite some time). Browsers can retrieve changing information
    from a server without having to refresh the page, using AJAX. Browsers may have been the laughing stock of the Internet years ago, but their
    usefulness in navigating Web pages and their ease of use has helped the Web grow rapidly. Let's hear it for Web browsers (but not Internet Explorer...)</p>
