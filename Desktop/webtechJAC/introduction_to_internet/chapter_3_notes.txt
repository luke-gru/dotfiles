Internet Searching

search query
keywords => more, specific, >=1, entered in search tool's search text box

search results list. Each Web page item in this list is called a 'hit'.
A natural language search is a search that is typed in complete sentences.
Stop words are ignored, just as in regular searches.
Targeted search => specific question, specific answer vs Open-ended search =>
more broad in scope
Websites and Credibility
Authority => top-level domain, primary sources, noted authority?, up-to-date?
Objectivity => bias?
Scope => intended scope? other sites?
Design + Functionality => Are they good?
Search tools: search directories, search engines and metasearch engines

Directory: human-compiled, hierarchical list of pages using categories and
subcategories (e.g. Yahoo directory). Drilling down the directory categories,
down the rabbit hole!
Lists of category and subcategory links already followed: breadcrumb trail
Search Engines: 3 tools => web crawler, software, index
web crawlers add urls to the searchable index
meta-tag keywords = spider-readable descriptive html tags
full-text searching: all the words on the page
search-engine software => software that includes the algorithm to rank web
pages in order of relevance
Metasearch Engine: compile results from various search tools into one results
list
Advanced Search Techniques: 
Boolean operators => logical operators like OR, AND and NOT
