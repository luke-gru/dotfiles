Github -- Social Coding

--Collaborate with other web designers and developers remotely on the same project, easily. 

--Follow your favourite designers and developers to see what they're up to!

--Download the same, updated version of a project that your friend, or a stranger whose work you like, has, and change it to your heart's content. 

--Download a version of a person's project, change it, and then send them the changes. If they like the work you did, they can publish these changes. Or you can!

--Follow (just like on Twitter) your friends or people whose work interests you. Or keep your eye on any project that interests you. You get a feed of all the updates of your followers (just the update message), and a feed of updates on the projects you're watching. You can also send friends and strangers messages, just like Twitter.




Problems with sending files via file-sharing or e-mail:

-web-based file-sharing in the 'cloud', like Dropbox, is great for a few files. But since there's no file compression, it's slow! Also, you can't work on two versions of the same project at the same time. Git allows you to do this (which will be demonstrated).

-emailing files is very annoying. Especially since you can't e-mail folders. In a project, often there are lots of folders.

Git's solutions: Git compresses your files into tiny blobs of data. This means that retrieving any version of a project, uploading any version of a project to Github or downloading any version of a project from Github is FAST!

*By fast, I mean **FAST**. Big projects ( > 16,000 files!) take around a second to upload or save a version. This means that you can save versions often, and publish them often.
