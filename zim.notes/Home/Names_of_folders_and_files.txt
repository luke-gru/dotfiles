====== Names of folders and files ======

**Layouts:**
There are many ways of specifying and using layouts in Rails.
If we create a template file in the //app/views/layouts// directory
with the same name as a controller, //all// views rendered by that controller will
use that layout by default.

*Applicaiton layout blankets the whole application unless...

**Note that the application layout is //overridden// if you have a controller-named layout in the layout directory and that controller is invoked upon browser req.
