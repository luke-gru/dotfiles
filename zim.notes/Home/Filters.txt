====== Filters ======
__before_filter__ arranges particular //methods// to be called before //actions//. If it's //not// specified, it arranges the method to be called before //all //actions. Very useful for providing website security and admin ability. To override the filters simply put a method in the controller with the same name that does nothing.

**Example where before_filter is specified to call authorize everywhere except in the 'login' action:**

**class** ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
//before_filter// :authorize, :except => :login
helper :all # include all helpers, all the time

//protected//
	**def** authorize

		unless User.find_by_id(session[:user_id])

			flash[:notice] = "Please log in"
			redirect_to :controller => 'admin' , :action => 'login'

		end

	**end**

end

//In this example, to override the authorization to browse the store, put a blank //authorize //action in the StoreController//

*Note that before_filter can also help code become more DRY
