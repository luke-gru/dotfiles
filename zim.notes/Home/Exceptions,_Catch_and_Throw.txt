====== Exceptions, Catch and Throw ======

**Exceptions:**
Exceptions let you package information about
an error into an object. That exception object is then propagated back up the calling stack //auto-//
//matically// until the runtime system finds code that explicitly declares that it knows how to handle
that type of exception.

**class Exception:**
→ Info about an exception is encapsulated in an object of class __Exception__ or one of class Exception's children.
→ When __raising__ an exception, you can use one of the built-in Exception classes (Pickaxe. p. 159), or make one of your own (make sure it's a subclass of StandardError or one of StandardError's children or it //won't //be caught by default).
→ Every exception has associated with it a //message string// and a //stack backtrace.//

//Pickaxe p. 160-164 for more info on exceptions, handling exceptions and raising exceptions//

**Catch and Throw: **
terminate process within bounds of catch an throw. Can hold values, too with the optional second param to __throw__. Pickaxe p. 165
