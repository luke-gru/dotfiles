====== Gotchas, Tips and Tricks ======

**Instance variables vs local variables:**

if @a					<<- won't return undefined local variable or method even if @a is undefined
	puts "hi"

end

if a

	puts "hi"			<<- will return undefined local variable or method if a is undefined

end

Local variables do not, like global and instance variables, have the value nil before initialization (definition)

**In the main object, instance methods are all private (no explicit receiver):**


**Local variable scope:**

proc { }
loop { }
class { }
module { }
def { }

**defined? is not assigned?**
a = 2
b = 1 if a == 1

if defined?b
  puts "hi"
end

=> "hi"

b is still defined even though not assigned to!

**Fixnum (and Bignum) are not references to the 1 object. Number 'objects' change their object id's dynamically.**
one = anotherone = 1

**Global variables:**
$_ (last value read by gets) and $~ (regexp match) actually have local scope
