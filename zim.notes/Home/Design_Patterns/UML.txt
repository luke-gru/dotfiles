====== UML ======

**Terms:**

__Association:__
A class holds, in a property, a reference to another class's object. Can be reciprocal or not, and can be 1->1, 1->n, etc...

UML representation: //Line with arrow(s)//

__Aggregation:__
Like association, but the referenced object forms an intrinsic part of the referring object.  **In aggregation, many**
**referring objects can have reference to the same object.**

UML representation: //Unfilled diamond.//

SchoolClass<>---------Pupil (school class aggregates pupils)

__Composition:__
Like aggregation, but **only one reffering object can contain the referenced object**. If the reffering object
is destroyed, the referenced objects are as well.

UML representation: //Filled diamond.//
