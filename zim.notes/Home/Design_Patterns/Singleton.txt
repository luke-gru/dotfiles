====== Singleton ======

**Singleton is used when an object needs to be available throughout the system, and**
**that object should always be the same instance.**

Make the constructor private, and make a public static method to get the instance. Store the instance in a static 
property named //instance. //If it's NULL, create the instance. If not, return it.

The properties should be a private hash of key-value pairs. The client code can setProp or getProp.
