====== Factory Method ======

**This pattern is used to create concrete instances that share an interface, and behave differently**
**depending on the subtype.**

Create an abstract class with the interface for the concrete factory classes (best if this interface isn't just... getClass).
The concrete factory classes subclass the abstract factory class, and return their own instances that inherit from the object
abstract class.  

**Problem:**
Special kind of duplication arises. Can't handle vertical scaling, adding new product classes without big rewrite.

**Often used with:**
Abstract factory pattern
