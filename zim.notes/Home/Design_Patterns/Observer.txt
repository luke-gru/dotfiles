====== Observer ======

**Achieve consistency between related objects through defining a one-to-many dependency**
**between objects. When one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated**
**automatically.**

Subject<>--------------- Observer1, Observer2
//aka publisher              aka subscriber//


Often, the subject passes arguments to update (push) or the observers demand access
to the subject's full state (pull).

Also, sometimes its nice to attach observers only for specific events (or aspects). This would
come as a second arg to attach().

Sometimes a change_manager object is required if it gets hairy (a mediator object that manages
change dependencies).
