====== Abstract Factory ======

**Like Factory pattern, but creates instances of multiple products that share a goal/have commonalities.**

Create abstract manager, for implementation of concrete managers. These managers are responsible for getting (returning) new
products of its family only. There are two or more product families, and the same amount of concrete managers.

The product objects inherit from their own abstract product class. For each kind of product, there is a new abstract product class
that handles the interface for the products.

**Problem:**
If you have too many product families, then it becomes annoying to maintain.
