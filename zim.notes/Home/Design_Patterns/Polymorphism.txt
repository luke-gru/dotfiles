====== Polymorphism (class switching) ======

**What is it?**
Maintenance of multiple implementations behind a common interface.

**Why do we use it?**
Client code can treat all children of an interface-defining superclass //the//
//same way//. This way, the client doesn't have to know about the classes, doesn't
have to type-check, etc... Also, at runtime, cool effects abound.

**When do we use it?**
Keep an eye out for excess conditionals in either client code or a class's instance
methods. This could signal that polymorphism is a good choice. Also, try to look
for classes that have many similarities regarding their //methods //(responsibilities).
