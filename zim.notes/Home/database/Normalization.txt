====== Normalization ======
**Vocab:**
Superkey: 					set of attributes in a relation that uniquely identify a tuple (row)
Candidate key: 			minimal set of attributes necessary to identify a tuple (row)
Prime attributes:			candidate keys
Non-prime attributes:	non-candidate keys			


**1NF:**
 __Objective:__ 
1) Wanted to make a query language that could uniquely identify one row in a database, or many rows


**Beyond 1NF:**
__Objective:__ 
1) To not have undesirable insertion, update and deletion //dependencies//
2) Reduce the need for future restructuring of relations as new //types //of data are introduced
3) Make relational model more informative to users
4) Make the collection of relations //neutral //to the //query statistics 			//=> think report-making


**2NF:**
A 1NF relation is in 2NF if and only if, given any //candidate key //K and any attribute A that is not a constituent of a candidate key, 
A depends upon the **whole** of K rather than just a part of it
__Note:__ a 1NF table is automatically 2NF if all the attributes are candidate keys (ie: there are no non-prime attributes)

Formal definition: A relation is 2NF if **all** its non-prime attributes are functionally dependent on the whole of every candidate key

**3NF:**
A 2NF relation is in 3NF if and only if every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively dependent (i.e. directly dependent) on every candidate key of R.

//Transitive dependency://
1) A → B
2) It is not the case that B → A
3) B → C

__Note:__ A 2NF table is automatically 3NF if the relation has less than 3 attributes

**Summary: 1NF - 3NF: **
Bill Kent: every non-key attribute "must provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key (so help me Codd)."
