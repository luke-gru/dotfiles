====== Unions ======

**UNION:**
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of __two or more__ SELECT statements.

Notice that each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns.
The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must
be in the same order.

//Format://
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name2

If any two rows are identical, UNION will take one only. Use //UNION ALL //to get back multiple
identical rows.
