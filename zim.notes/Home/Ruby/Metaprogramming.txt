====== Metaprogramming ======

**Modules and mixins - caveat**
Note that Module static methods are useless when included or extended in a class, as only their instance methods are accessible from classes that include them.

**Anonymous singleton classes vs class objects**

class << Test
self here is Test's anonymous singleton class, so defining a method here like below would not work

end

class Test
	def self.hello

		puts "hello"

	end

end

Test.hello

**Hook methods**

Module.included(host_class)
