====== Embedding in HTML ======

**How to Embed or Source JS:**
1. Between a pair of <script> and </script> tags (can appear anywhere)
2. From an external file specified by the src attribute of a <script src="URI"> </script>
3. In an event handler, specified as the value of an HTML attribute such as onclick or onmouseover
4. As the body of a URL that uses the special javascript: protocol


When using //<script type="text/javascript"> ... </script>, //if there are lots of scripts this gets annoying, so in the <head>, put:
__<meta http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" content="text/javascript">__

This will make all scripts javascript by default (even though most (all?) browsers do this anyway).

**Parsing along w/ HTML:**
Execution of scripts occurs as part of the web browser's HTML parsing process. So if a
script appears in the <head> section of an HTML document, NONE of the <body> section
of the document has been defined yet. This means that the JavaScript objects that
represent the contents of the document body, such as Form and Link, have not been
created yet and cannot be manipulated by that code.

Remember that //defining// a function is not the same as executing it. It is perfectly safe to
define a function that manipulates objects that have not yet been created. Just take care
that the function is not executed or invoked until the necessary variables, objects, and so
on all exist.

**Parsing and Event Handlers:**
Defining an event handler as the value of an onclick or another HTML attribute is much
like defining a JavaScript function:// the code is not immediately executed.//

Event handlers should not take long to run because the user cannot interact with your program until
the program has finished handling the event.

The fact that event handlers can be invoked before a document is fully loaded has two
important implications. Event-handled functions should go in the <head> section

The event handler should not attempt to manipulate HTML objects that have not yet been parsed and created.

**Testing for Existence of object:**
When you manipulate objects in other forms or other frames, there starts to be a concern. One technique is to test for the
existence of the object you want to manipulate before you manipulate it. You can do this
simply by comparing it (and any parent objects) to null. //See Definitive Guide 193//

To be safe, use the __onload__ [[Home:JS:Client:Event Handlers|event handler]]




**Versions:**
<script language="JavaScript1.5">			=> browsers that don't have the interpreter will ignore this. JS1.2 is not compatible w/ ECMA

**Writing scripts to different execution environments:**
<script>
f1.document.write("<script>");
f1.document.write("document.write('<h2>This is the quoted
script</h2>')");
f1.document.write(__"</" + "script>"__);			=> must do this or else JS will stop THIS script!
</script>

**Deferring Execution:**
<script defer>
// Any JavaScript code that does not call document.write();		=> will execute when necessary
</script>
