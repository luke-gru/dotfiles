====== Event Handlers ======

**Start with on[...]**
//Calling functions is more idiomatic than arbitrary expressions//
<input type="checkbox" name="opts" value="ignore-case" onclick="ignore-case = this.checked;">		=> Here, //this //is [object HTMLInputElement]
																							//this.checked //is true if checked, false if not


__onclick__		=> if it returns false, there is no //default// action associated with the element (example, <a> doesn't go anywhere)

__onmousedown, onmouseup__		=> supported by all tags


__onmouseover, onmouseout__		=> supported by all tags, if used with <a> the URL is not shown in the status line

__onchange__			=> supported by <input>, <textarea> and <select>. Triggered when user changes input //and then focus//

__onsubmit, onreset__		=> supported by <form> tag, triggered when the form //is about to be //submitted or reset. Return of false will cancel the operation. Often used
							for form validation

__onload__		=> document fully loaded. supported by //body// and //frameset// tags. 

//Setting a flag on body onload is smart://
<body onload="window.fullyLoaded = true;">

	<form>

		<input type="button" value="Do It!" onclick="if (window.fullyLoaded) doit()

	</form>

</body>

__onunload__		=> transition to new page, quick cleanup scripts or something, use sparingly

**Protocol:**
//Executes statments, return value of last statement is displayed in browser unless return value is false. If return value is false, do not modify original contents of window//

javascript:window.open("about:blank"); void 0;		=> void is necessary

//Other applications://
javascript: URLs can also be used as the __href__ value of a hyperlink. When the user
clicks on the link, the specified JavaScript code is executed. Or, if you specify a
javascript: URL as the value of the __action attribute__ of a <form> tag, the JavaScript
code in the URL is executed when the user submits the form. In these contexts, the
javascript: URL is essentially a substitute for an event handler.
