====== Arrays ======

**Objects Behaving Like Arrays:**
var c = new Circle(1,2,3);
c[0] = "this is an array element of an object!"		=> actually just creates a property of the object, the object is not a numeric array

**Properties:**
ary.length		=> 1 larger than the biggest index of the array. Read/write, you can truncate the length of an array or expand it.

**Methods:**
ary.join(/sep/ or 'sep')		=> "1,2,3,4"	=> defaults to comma-separated
ary.reverse()					=> reverses the array in place
ary.sort([func])				=> sorts in alphabetic (default) or through //comparison function. (return result < 0 : arg1 before, 0 or > 0 : arg1 after)//
ary.concat(ary1,[ary2],...)	=> concats the arrays, flattening the first inner dimension
ary.slice(start,end)					=> quirk: if the second num in range is negative, -1 is actually -2 (in Ruby), -2 is -3 (and so on...). Only for the second num in the range
ary.splice(arg1, [arg2])		=> only arg1, delete the array elements from hereon in and return them in a new array.
								=> 2 args, delete elements at these positions and return them in a new array
								=> more args, process start at first arg, take up 2nd arg positions (delete this many args and return them) and insert arg3, arg4
ary.push						=> returns the new length of the array!
ary.pop						=> //returns the value that it removed//
ary.unshift					=> returns the new length of the array!
ary.shift						=> returns the first element of the array
ary.toString					=> does an ary.join()
ary.toLocaleString			=> toLocaleString's each element and then concats them
