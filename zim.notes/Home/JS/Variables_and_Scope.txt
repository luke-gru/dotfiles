====== Variables and Scope ======

**Scope**
When variables are defined in a function, they are available (and defined!) throughout the function (wherever they're defined). For example, inside nested functions they're also available.

**Declaration**
Variables not declared by var are implicity declared and are global variables.

**Scope Chain**
Scope chain runs up from call scope to global scope, and everything in between that follows the chain. Top-level object is global object. Other objects are called call objects.

**With (Javascript's instance_eval)**
with (object)							=> with is considered bad practice
statement

//Variables are, most of the time, just as convenient://
var form = frames[1].document.forms[0];
form.name.value = "";
form.address.value = "";
form.email.value = "";
