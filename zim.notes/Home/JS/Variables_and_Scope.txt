====== Variables and Scope ======

**Scope**
When variables are defined in a function, they are available (and defined!) throughout the function (wherever they're defined). For example, inside nested functions they're also available.

**Declaration**
Variables not declared by var are implicity declared and are global variables.

**Scope Chain**
Scope chain runs up from call scope to global scope, and everything in between that follows the chain.
