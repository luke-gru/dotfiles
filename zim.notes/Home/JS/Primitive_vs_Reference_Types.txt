====== Primitive vs Reference Types ======

**Primitive:**
Numbers (all numbers are floating-point in JS)				<= all are 8 bytes
Strings (not really primitive, but act as primitive. Actually immutable reference type)
Boolean, null, undefined

**Reference:**
Arrays
Objects
Functions

Reference the same area in memory. Example: if var 'a' has a value with a reference type and 'b' = 'a', and a is changed, b is changed. 	<= This isn't so for primitive types
