====== attributes ======

Attributes are //methods// that are exposed to the user to update and read information about an object's state. Within a class definition, attribute methods are //instance methods//.

**Create attribute readers:**
attr_reader //:price, :bookname//

**Create attribute writers:**
attr_writer //:etc//

**Create attribute reader/writers:**
attr_accessor //:name,// //:etc//

Attributes can also update and read information about Classes. Simply add a singleton method to the class like this:

class Test1
	class << self

		attr_accessor //:value//

	end

end

Test1.value = 99
Test1.value													=> 99
