====== ORM (Object Relational Mapping) ======

* ORM libs wrap db tables with classes
* objects in class Order (model Order) for example, are //rows //in the database
* attributes of the object are used to get and set the individual columns of the table
* Class-level operations of the Model are used to perform table-level operations
* ActiveRecord is the ORM layer with Rails

An example of one of these Class methods is .find, which can return one object or many objects by iterating over the table

//An example of a simple Order (model) class method://
**Order**__.find__(:all, :conditions => "name='dave'" ).each do |order|
order.discount = 0.5															<<- Here, discount would be a column in the table //orders//
order.save
**end**
