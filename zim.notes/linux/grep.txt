====== grep ======

the following is really notes on **egrep, grep -E (extended regex)**


$egrep 'foo' filename												<<- return all lines with 'foo' in them
$ls | egrep 'blah'													<<- grep accepts stdin from commands

**options**
-v				=> print lines that don't match (invert the meaning of a match)
-c				=> count the lines that match
-w				=> word regex
 -F				=> fixed strings (same as fgrep)
-f filename	=> read patterns from file, 1 per line
-i				=> case insensitive
-l				=> list files with match
-L				=> list files without match
-n				=> print line number preceding matched line
-C num			=> print num lines of ouput context
-R				=> recursive

**grep regular expressions**
.		=> any char
* => 0 or more
+		=> 1 or more
?		=> 1 or 0
^  		=> beg. of line
$		=> end of line
|		=> or
\<, \>	=> word boundary
{2,4}	=> at least 2, at most 4
{4}		=> exactly 4
[ ] => char. classes (any)
[^ ]		=> any that isnt in this char class
[0-9a-zA-z]		=> char class ranges
[]^[-]				=> note that this is 4 literal chars in this char class (char class positioning)
\w, \W				=> alnum [0-9a-zA-Z] and not alnum
\b, \B				=> word boundary, not word boundary
\1, \2				=> backreferences

**Portability**
\{ is better than {
[{] is the best literal { matcher
